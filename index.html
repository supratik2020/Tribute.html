    		<strong>Stephen William Hawking CH CBE FRS FRSA (8 January 1942 â€“ 14 March 2018)</strong><br> was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author who was director of research<br> at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge at the<br> time of his death.He was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the<br> University of Cambridge between 1979 and 2009.

            Hawking was born in Oxford into<br> a <u>family of doctors.</u> He began his university education at <strong>University College, Oxford,</strong><br> in October 1959 at the age of 17, where he received a first-class BA degree in physics. He began<br> his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in October 1962, where he obtained his PhD degree<br> in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology in March 1966.<br> In 1963, Hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease that gradually<br> paralysed him over the decades. After the loss of his speech, he communicated through a<br> <u>speech-generating device</u> initially through use<br> of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle.<br>

            Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational<br> singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity and the theoretical prediction<br> that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial.<br> By the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted<br> as a significant breakthrough in theoretical physics. Hawking was the first<br> to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and<br> quantum mechanics. He was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.

            Hawking achieved commercial success with several<br> works of popular science in which he discussed his theories and cosmology in general. His book<br> A Brief History of Time appeared on the Sunday Times bestseller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks. Hawking was<br> a Fellow of the Royal Society, a lifetime member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of<br> the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States. In 2002,<br> Hawking was ranked number 25 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.<br> He died on 14 March 2018 at the age of 76, after living with motor neurone disease for more than 50 years.
